# Nordic

The nordic theme aims to be an improved alternative for the [official Nord Theme for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio). 
It features hand-tuned color combinations to achieve a clean Nord-themed coding experience.

The original colors and recommended color combinations can be found on the [Nord website](https://www.nordtheme.com/) or in the [Nord GitHub repository](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord).

## Installation

Simply add the Extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DennisStanze.nordic-001) and restart Visual Studio. 

You can also download the `.vsix` file in the [Releases](https://github.com/dst80/nordic/releases) section and open it with the Visual Studio Installer program (double-click).

## Issues

The project is still in an early state of development, therefore you might run into issues like incorrect foreground/background color pairings or invisible text. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dst80/nordic/issues) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/dst80/nordic/pulls), so we can fix those issues together. 

Also, some Visual Studio windows cannot be themed, leading to inconsistent styles in some parts of the application.
